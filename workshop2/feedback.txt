Good job Jiasi, it seems to be working correctly and you successfully used factories/services. 20/20  Some notes below

1)
	/* 
		really the time when we want to create a factory is when we want something to hold some data *and* have some
		functions that operate on that data. It's not bad, but it's just not helping you very much to this.

		I would consider pulling more information into the factory like the average/grade/passing etc.
	*/
	.factory('Assignment', function() {
	    function Assignment(name, grade) {
	        this.name = name;
	        this.grade = grade;
	    }
		return Assignment;
	})



2)

	/*
		The calculate grade function is calculating the average every single if
		statement.  This is ineffiencent.  You've already calculated the average
		from the function before this one.  You can just pass that average in and use
		it.
	*/

	self.calculateGrade=function(assignmentList){
		if(self.calculateAverage(assignmentList)>90)
			return 'A';
		else if(self.calculateAverage(assignmentList)>80)
			return 'B';
		else if (self.calculateAverage(assignmentList)>70)
			return 'C';
		else return 'F';
	};
